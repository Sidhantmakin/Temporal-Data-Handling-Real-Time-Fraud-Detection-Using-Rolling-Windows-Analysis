# Temporal-Data-Handling-Real-Time-Fraud-Detection-Using-Rolling-Windows-Analysis

Overview:
Objective: Real-time fraud detection using rolling windows for temporal data analysis.  

Techniques Used:  
In this project, we employ several strategies to guarantee efficient fraud detection in real-time. While rolling window analysis assists in capturing statistical measurements over predetermined time periods, temporal data handling is used to better identify time-based trends in transaction data. By learning the typical transaction patterns and spotting deviations, autoencoders—a type of unsupervised deep learning—are used for anomaly identification. Frameworks like Spark are used to emulate real-time streaming, which allows the system to evaluate live data streams for immediate fraud detection. 
   
Sections (Assumed Typical Flow): 
1. Data Loading & Preprocessing:
A credit card fraud dataset is imported during the data loading and preprocessing stage, after which it is ready for analysis. To maintain consistency and enhance model performance, this stage involves addressing missing values and normalizing the data.

2. Feature Engineering (Rolling Windows):
The usage of rolling windows to divide the dataset over time is the main goal of feature engineering. By using temporal aggregation approaches, statistical measures can be calculated over predetermined time periods, effectively capturing time-based patterns.

3. Model Training:
An autoencoder, a deep learning architecture for unsupervised anomaly detection, is used during the model training phase. The algorithm learns typical transaction patterns from non-fraudulent data to identify any discrepancies that would point to fraudulent activity. 

4. Real-Time Simulation:
Using Spark or a comparable framework, transaction data streaming is simulated in the real-time simulation portion. This makes it possible for the model to process real-time data streams, guaranteeing real-time fraud detection capabilities.


5. Evaluation & Metrics:
In the last stage, the model's performance is assessed using common metrics such as the F1-score and ROC AUC. By contrasting expected and actual findings, these indicators aid in evaluating the fraud detection system's accuracy and dependability.
